This is a mock eCommerce app inspired by Zero To Mastey's Complete React Developer Course on Udemy. This is a fully fledged web app taking advantage of may technologies and dependencies and was extensively worked on and refacored to be it's present state.

## Technologies

Writted with Jsx and styled initially with Scss (Sass) and then refactored using Styled Components. (I still prefer Scss but I can see where styled components has its utility). As of 01/12/2023 the intention of the application is to now incorporate Redux into the application and also refactor the code using TypeScript. Later on I will also be adding GraphQL and connecting the app to the Stripe (payment processing) application so that it can mirror a real world eCommerce app. I will likely be using these skills very soon with another eCommerce app i am writing up on the side (from scratch).
